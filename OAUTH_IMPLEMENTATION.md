# Google OAuth Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Backend Changes**
- Added Authlib library to `requirements.txt`
- Installed Authlib and dependencies
- Added OAuth configuration to `app.py`
- Created two new routes:
  - `/login/google` - Initiates Google OAuth flow
  - `/authorize/google` - Handles OAuth callback
- Automatic user account creation for new Google sign-ins
- Secure password generation for OAuth users

### 2. **Frontend Changes**
- Updated `templates/login.html` - Google button now redirects to OAuth flow
- Updated `templates/signup.html` - Google button now redirects to OAuth flow
- Removed placeholder JavaScript alerts
- Changed buttons to proper links

### 3. **Configuration Files**
- Created `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- Created `.env` - Your local environment configuration
- Created `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide

## üîß What You Need to Do

### Get Google OAuth Credentials

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create/Select a project**
3. **Enable Google+ API** (or People API)
4. **Create OAuth Client ID**:
   - Type: Web application
   - Authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/authorize/google`
5. **Copy your credentials**

### Update Your .env File

Edit `/Users/qpan/Downloads/volunteer-app/.env`:
```env
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret
```

### Test It Out

1. Restart your Flask app (if it's running)
2. Go to http://localhost:5000/login
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. You'll see an error until you add real Google credentials

## üéØ How It Works

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirected to Google's login page
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Google redirects back to your app with user info
5. App creates account (if new user) or logs in existing user
6. User is redirected to dashboard

## üîí Security Features

- Passwords for OAuth users are randomly generated and unguessable
- Environment variables keep credentials secure
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks
- Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol
- HTTPS required for production

## üìù Notes

- Users can sign in with both email/password AND Google
- If an email already exists, Google login will work for that account
- Usernames are auto-generated from email addresses
- All OAuth users are created with 'volunteer' role by default
